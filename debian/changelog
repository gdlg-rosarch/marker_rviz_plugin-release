ros-kinetic-marker-rviz-plugin (0.0.1-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed covariance orientation bugs. It seems to work correctly now. (At least for the few axis used in the stage and gazebo slam demo.)
  * Added rviz config for send_demo_msg.py demo script.
  * Code cleanup.
  * Added scaled cylinders as visuals for orientational variance.
  * Array out of bounds fix.
  * Copy paste bug fix
  * Implemented marker_with_covariance_array display.
  * Implemented marker with covariance. Currently only position covariance is displayed. No orientation yet.
  * Implemented marker label to show marker id.
  * Added demo data script for plugin testing.
  * The visual marker (and most of the ogre specific parts) are now defined in marker.cpp for easier reuse in the upcoming covariance code. Segfault is also fixed now.
  * Merge branch 'devel' of github.com:tuw-robotics/marker_rviz_plugin into devel
  * Added details regarding the segfault.
  * Working marker visualization. There are definitly memory leaks somewhere in there and rviz does quit with segfault if exit is used.
  * Added two properties to hide or show visuals.
  * Added axes as orientation indicator and fixed plane orientation.
  * Cleanup. Removed backface culling.
  * Trying to render a few basic ogre objects (including meshes and textures).
  * Added description in package.xml
  * CMakeList.txt changed to work with Qt5 and Qt4
  * Introduced rviz plugins for marker_msgs::MarkerWithCovarianceStamped.msg and marker_msgs::MarkerWithCovarianceArray.msg
  * plugin working
  * first commit
  * Initial commit
  * Contributors: Markus Bader, doctorseus, mmacsek
